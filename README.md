# PHASE-3-PROJECT

# Project Title
# Customer Churn prediction for SyriaTel
# Project Overview

In this project we are building a classification model to predict whether a customer will stop transacting with Syriatel, which is mobile network provider. We will use machine learning algorithms to build a classifier suited for the best predictions of why customers opt out of business with  the above service provider. 

# Business understanding
There were 8,500,000 Internet users in Syria as of March 2021 for a 46.5% Internet penetration rate. The growth of Internet users has been rapid since 2016,making the telcom market competitive. The SyriaTelcom therefore need to devise for ways to ratain customers, win more customer and increase their sales revenue.The Churn in Telecomâ€™s dataset is obtained from Kaggle and contains information on customers that have left and those who are still transacting using syriatel.

# Stake holders

This data is important to: 
*The Syriatel Mobile Telecom company
*Shareholders
*Employees
*Customers

# Modelling
Have used different models to see the model that yields the best results from the predictions.

Models used:

*Logistic Regression

*DecisionTreeClassifier

*RandomForestClassifier


Logistic regression results.
Accuracy: 0.84
precision:0.89
recall:0.94
f1-score:0.91

Decision Tree results
Accuracy: 0.82
precision:0.95
recall:0.84
f1-score:0.89

Random Forest results:
Accuracy: 0.90
precision:0.94
recall:0.94
f1-score:0.94

# Model Evaluation
The Random Forest Classifier is a better model with an accuracy score of 90.25%

# Conclusion
In conclusion, our analysis suggests that we can accurately predict customer churn using
Random Forest Classifier as the  machine learning model due to its high accuracy.
 
 # Recommendations:

*We recomend SyriaTel to reduce on the day charges as most customers call for longer hours during the day, which may have contributed to more churns.

*Reduce also on the international charges to encourage customers to make frequent calls as internatinal calls tend to be more expensive.

*Intergrate technology and come up with online solutions to reduce on customer service calls.

*Rampant campaigns and promotions to win back churned customers.
